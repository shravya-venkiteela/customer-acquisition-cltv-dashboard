# Customer Acquisition Channel Analysis

This project analyzes the performance of various customer acquisition channels using both **Python** and **Power BI**. The goal is to help businesses identify which channels are the most cost-effective and profitable in terms of **conversion**, **revenue**, **ROI**, and **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (pandas, plotly, seaborn):** Data analysis, CLTV and ROI calculations, visualizations
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard with charts and slicers
- **DAX:** For calculated columns inside Power BI (ROI, CLTV)
- **Jupyter Notebook / PDF:** Documentation and explanation of the analysis steps

---

## Project Objectives

- Compare **acquisition costs** across marketing channels
- Evaluate **conversion efficiency**
- Measure **revenue generated** by each channel
- Calculate **ROI** and **CLTV**
- Provide actionable insights through a clean, interactive dashboard
